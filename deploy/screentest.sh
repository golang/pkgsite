  Usage: $0 [OPTIONS] [exp|dev|staging|prod] [IDTOKEN]

  Run the screentest check against a live instance of the given environment.
  These tests will only pass against staging and prod.
  If IDTOKEN is omitted, it is read from the file _ID_TOKEN.

  Options:
    -neverfail
      Do not return a non-zero exit code, even if the screentests fail.
      This causes Cloud Build to upload screentest results for debugging.
      It should never be used as part of a normal deployment.
