| GO_DISCOVERY_E2E_TEST_PORT           | Port of headless browser in e2e test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| GO_DISCOVERY_ENABLE_QUOTA            | Whether the quota check is enabled. Set in all environments (except exp). The motivation for keeping this is that if the quota system somehow breaks in a way that restricts a lot of traffic unintentionally, we could quickly disable it. That seems unlikely (the quota system fails open, not closed) so we could remove this. |
| GO_DISCOVERY_EXCLUDED_FILENAME       | Path to the file of excluded prefixes. Read by the worker to populate the DB. We could hardcode this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| GO_DISCOVERY_FRONTEND_TASK_QUEUE     | Task queue used by frontend service for frontend fetch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GO_DISCOVERY_GAE_LOCATION_ID         | LocationID is essentially hard-coded until we figure out a good way to determine it programmatically, but we check an environment variable in case it needs to be overridden.                                                                                                                                                      |
| GO_DISCOVERY_GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER_ID   | Used by frontend templates to send data to GTM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| GO_DISCOVERY_LOG_LEVEL               | Used to set the log level output from servers when developing to reduce noise. Defaults to debug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| GO_DISCOVERY_MAX_IN_FLIGHT_ZIP_MI    | Used for load shedding. Hardcoded in worker docker file and prevents workers from getting overloaded and crashing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| GO_DISCOVERY_MAX_MODULE_ZIP_MI       | Used for load shedding - doesnâ€™t seem to ever be set. Useful if worker is always dying on a specific large module. Set to stop this module.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| GO_DISCOVERY_NPX_CMD                 | Used for local development to set npx command location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| GO_DISCOVERY_QUEUE_AUDIENCE          | QueueAudience is used to allow the Cloud Tasks queue to authorize itself to the worker. It should be the OAuth 2.0 client ID associated with the IAP that is gating access to the worker.                                                                                                                                          |
| GO_DISCOVERY_QUEUE_URL               | QueueURL is the URL that the Cloud Tasks queue should send requests to. It should be used when the worker is not on AppEngine.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GO_DISCOVERY_QUOTA_QPS               | Part of QuotaSettings -- allowed queries per second, per IP block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| GO_DISCOVERY_QUOTA_RECORD_ONLY       | Part of QuotaSettings -- Record data about blocking, but do not actually block. This is a \*bool, so we can distinguish "not present" from "false" in an override.                                                                                                                                                                 |
