# Frontend

The _frontend_ presents user-facing web pages on pkg.go.dev.

For additional information on functionality of the frontend, see the
[design document](design.md).

## Development

The main program lives in `cmd/frontend`. The bulk of the code lives in
`internal/frontend`.

See [experiment.md](experiment.md) for instructions how to enable experiments.

### Running

You can run the frontend locally like so:

    go run ./cmd/frontend [-dev] [-direct_proxy]

- The `-dev` flag reloads templates on each page load and rebuilds JavaScript
  assets when TypeScript source files change.

The frontend can use one of three datasources:

- Postgres database
- Proxy service

The `Datasource` interface implementation is available at internal/datasource.go.

You can use the `-direct_proxy` flag to run the frontend with its datasource as
the proxy service. This allows you to run the frontend without setting up a
postgres database.

Alternatively, you can run pkg.go.dev with a local database. See instructions
on how to [set up](postgres.md) and
[populate](worker.md#populating-data-locally-using-the-worker)
your local database with packages of your choice.

You can then run the frontend with: `go run ./cmd/frontend`

If you add, change or remove any inline scripts in templates, run
`devtools/cmd/csphash` to update the hashes. Running `all.bash`
will do that as well.

### Local mode

You can also use run the frontend locally with an in-memory datasource
populated with modules loaded from your local filesystem.

    go run ./cmd/pkgsite [path1,path2]

This allows you to run the frontend without setting up a database and to view
documentation of local modules without requiring a proxy. The command accepts a
list of comma-separated strings each representing a path of a module to load
into memory.

### Screentest

In addition to tests written in Go inside internal/frontend and
internal/testing/integration, pages on pkg.go.dev may have image snapshot tests.
These tests will create diffs for inspection on failure.

These tests are in the [tests/screentest/ directory](../tests/screentest). For
details, see [tests/README.md](../tests/README.md).

## Static Assets

JavaScript assets for pkg.go.dev are compiled from TypeScript files in the
content/static/js directory. The compiled assets are committed to the repo so the
frontend or worker service can be run without any additional steps from a new
clone of the project.

### Building

When modifying any TypeScript code, you must run
`go run ./devtools/cmd/static` before committing your changes.

### Testing

You can test html and static asset changes by running `npm test`.
This will run the TypeScript type checker and unit tests.

### Linting

Lint your changes by running `npm run lint`. This will run stylelint
and eslint on CSS and TS files in content/static. You can autofix some errors by
running `npm run lint -- --fix`.

### Running npm commands with docker

To run the the unit tests or linters without installing npm prefix the
command with `./all.bash`. This will run the npm through a docker
container that has the pkgsite code mounted in an internal directory.

`./all.bash npm run <command>`
